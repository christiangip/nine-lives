# Development Log — Nine Lives

Chronological, patch-notes-style progress notes — one entry per task list — split out of
`CLAUDE.md` to keep that file a short, high-level guide. Each entry records what landed,
what was deferred (with `↩ From` breadcrumbs), headless GUT counts, and F6 "feel" sign-offs.

For the project overview, architecture, folder map, and conventions see
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md); canonical design lives in `docs/GDD.md` and the task lists in
`docs/tasks/`.

**Checkbox legend:** `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` DoD met.

## Task progress notes
- **01 — Project Setup & Tooling:** authoring complete (9 autoloads incl. the new `SettingsManager`;
  `Main.tscn` → placeholder Main Menu; InputManager gamepad defaults + runtime rebind + `settings.cfg`
  persistence; SettingsManager schema/persistence; GUT vendored + 3 new tests). **In-engine verification
  (open editor, regenerate `.godot/`, green `run_tests.sh`) is pending a machine with Godot 4.6** — those
  DoD boxes are marked `[~]` in `docs/tasks/01_project_setup.md` until confirmed. Mark them `[x]` after a
  clean editor open + green test run. **Update 2026-06-29:** headless GUT now runs **green on
  Godot 4.6.3** (`.godot/` regenerated via `--import`), and the interactive "open editor → reach
  Main Menu" smoke (FR-01-2) passed — so **01 is complete** (`[x]`). Only residual: bare `godot`
  on PATH for the convenience `run_tests.sh`/CI (the User PATH entry points at the `.exe` file, not
  its directory; a session restart is also needed).
- **02 — Core Architecture & Data Framework:** **complete & verified green** on Godot 4.6.3 (headless
  GUT 22/22). Added a **10th autoload `Content`** (content-registry hub — one generic `ContentRegistry`
  per def type, in `game/systems/core/`), a `Services` static locator, a validated `GameManager` state
  machine + fade hook, the `EventBus.game_state_changed` signal, and a `SaveManager.migrate()` schema
  hook. Fixed a latent `01` bug: `SettingsManager.load()` shadowed Godot's global `load()` → renamed
  `load_config()`.
- **03 — Player Controller & Camera (FP):** **code + automated DoD complete & verified green** on
  Godot 4.6.3 (headless GUT **41/41**). Filled in `game/scenes/player/PlayerController.gd` (+ new
  `PlayerController.tscn`): locomotion/stamina, Stand/Crouch/Prone (collider+eye lerp, ceiling-blocked
  stand-up), clamped mouse + gamepad-axis look (`SettingsManager` sens/invert, refreshed on
  `settings_changed`), collision-safe lean, interaction ray (tap/hold), surface-tagged footstep noise on
  `EventBus.noise_emitted` with Silence scaling, and task-08 carry hooks. **No magic numbers** — all
  tunables in a new `PlayerConfigDef` (`game/resources/_defs/`) + `default_player.tres`; added
  `stamina`/`silence` `AttributeDef` instances and two gameplay settings (`crouch_toggle`/`sprint_toggle`).
  **EventBus stayed frozen** (its contract test asserts the exact signal set + zero methods), so player
  readability uses **local signals** + the `&"player"` group; detection (04) reads stance via that group.
  Tests favor pure seams (`compute_noise_radius`, `update_stamina`, `update_hold`, `_resolve_interactable`)
  so they're headless-deterministic. **Complete (`[x]`):** the manual F6 "feel" playtest
  (`game/scenes/player/PlayerGreybox.tscn`) was signed off **2026-06-30**. That playtest surfaced a latent
  bug — `project.godot [input]` had been authored in **Godot-3 dict format** (`{"type":"key","keycode":N}`),
  which Godot 4 silently drops, leaving every keyboard/mouse action unbound (only mouse-look worked); fixed
  by regenerating the section as native `Object(InputEventKey,…)` via `ProjectSettings.save()`.
  *(Pre-existing, unrelated: `test_carry_system.gd` `preload`s a not-yet-existing `Inventory.gd` (task 08)
  → GUT ignores that one script; suite still exits 0.)*
- **04 — Stealth & Detection:** **code + automated DoD complete & verified green** on Godot 4.6.3
  (headless GUT **64/64**). Fleshed out `game/systems/stealth/DetectionSensor.gd` into the legibility
  core: **pure, deterministic seams** (`is_in_cone`, `distance_factor`, `movement_factor`,
  `compute_fill_rate`, `step_fill`, `state_for_fill`/`step_state`, `hearing_bump`) wrapped by thin
  node glue (`_physics_process` cone test + **multi-ray LoS that doubles as cover** → visibility
  fraction; `_sample_light_level` via `&"shadow"` Area3D; `_on_noise_emitted` sound channel). The
  **5-state machine** runs Unaware→Suspicious→Searching→Alerted (fill thresholds) with
  **Alerted/Pursuit latched** ("full detection commits to alert", GDD §8.3) and Suspicious/Searching
  recovering on decay; sound alone is capped below Alerted. **EventBus stayed frozen** — it already
  declared `detection_changed`/`player_spotted`/`noise_emitted` (locked by the contract test), so no
  signal changes. **No magic numbers:** all curve/threshold tunables live in a new `DetectionConfigDef`
  (+ `default_detection.tres`), registered as an **11th `Content` registry** (`Content.detection`);
  per-actor cone/hearing geometry comes from `EnemyDef` (added `default_guard.tres`). Readability HUD
  widgets are deferred to task 15 (this ships the signal data + a dev `DetectionConeDebug` wedge); AI
  behaviors that consume `state`/`last_seen_position`/`last_heard_position` are task 05; PURSUIT
  escalation is task 10. **Residual (`[~]`):** the manual F6 "feel" playtest on the new
  `game/scenes/player/DetectionGreybox.tscn` (walk a cone, hug shadow, recover by breaking LoS) — mark
  `[x]` after in-engine sign-off, mirroring task 03.
- **05 — AI Actors:** **M0 guard core + Phase 05.2 coordination — code + automated DoD complete &
  verified green** on Godot 4.6.3 (headless GUT **93/93**, +6 task-05 tests). Fleshed out
  `game/systems/ai/GuardAI.gd` (`CharacterBody3D`) into a state machine (PATROL/INVESTIGATE/SEARCH/
  COMBAT/DOWNED) driven by its child `DetectionSensor` via **pure deterministic seams**
  (`next_waypoint_index`, `ai_state_for_detection`, `behavior_severity`, `reached`, `tick_timer`,
  `investigate_next`/`search_next`, `search_offset`, `within_propagation_radius`) + thin steering
  glue: loops a waypoint route, peels off to investigate `last_seen`/`last_heard`, does a local
  **sweep** around the contact, and **recovers** (drops back to patrol when the lead goes stale).
  **Post-review fix:** detection reactions are now **escalate-only** — a rising meter promotes the
  guard, but decay-driven downgrades no longer yank it out of an in-progress investigate/search
  (those wind down on their own timers, so FR-05-1's loop actually completes); non-combat leads
  route through INVESTIGATE first so SEARCH sweeps a real ring (`search_radius`) rather than freezing
  in place. Regression-locked by `test_guard_detection_reaction.gd`. `take_down()` drops a discoverable
  **`Body`** (`game/systems/ai/Body.gd`, group `&"body"`, `concealed` flag + drag/hide hook for 08)
  and arms a **`RadioCheckin`** (`game/systems/ai/RadioCheckin.gd`, fakeable-count → `alarm_tripped`).
  Guards scan their cone for un-concealed bodies (`body_discovered`) and **propagate** alerts to
  nearby guards on a teammate's spot/search/body-find. **EventBus stayed frozen** — it already
  declared `body_discovered`/`alarm_tripped`/`player_spotted`/`detection_changed` (locked by the
  contract test), so no signal changes. **No magic numbers:** behavior tunables live in a new
  **`AIConfigDef`** (+ `default_ai.tres`) registered as a **12th `Content` registry** (`Content.ai`);
  per-actor senses/health/speed in `EnemyDef`, now with a `tier` + pure `scaled(mult)` for
  data-driven difficulty (FR-05-9). Dev greybox `game/scenes/ai/GuardGreybox.tscn` (direct-steer,
  no nav-mesh bake). **Deferred (↩ notes added to the blocking task docs):** **05.3** full sensor
  roster (cameras/operator/dogs/civilians/inspector → 06 keycards / 11 population), **05.4** combat AI
  (`_tick_combat` is a converge-only stub → task 10), **05.5** perf round-robin (→ 11). **Residual
  (`[~]`):** the manual F6 "feel" sign-off on `GuardGreybox.tscn` — mark M0 DoD `[x]` after it,
  mirroring tasks 03/04.
- **06 — Heist Mechanics & Obstacles:** **obstacle catalogue — code + automated DoD complete &
  verified green** on Godot 4.6.3 (headless GUT **112/112**, +19 task-06 tests). The puzzle-box
  catalogue is data-driven: a new **`ObstacleDef`** (`id`, `category` enum, `difficulty_tier`,
  `valid_solutions`, `noise_by_solution`, shared tunables + `params`) registered as the **13th
  `Content` registry `Content.obstacles`** (16 authored `.tres` archetypes). 13 `Interactable`
  subclasses in `game/systems/obstacles/` extend a small `Obstacle` base (def resolution + the
  `solution_set()`/`difficulty()` query API that 11/13 will read + frozen-EventBus/group effects) via
  **pure static seams**: `Lock.snap_chance`/`should_snap` (consumable `PickPouch`),
  `HackTarget.in_proximity`/`step_progress` (proximity-lock pause/resume; camera loop-vs-disable; e-lock
  power-cut), `Safe.can_skip` (combo-clue bypass), `FuseBox.affects`/`cut_power` (zone power-cut + backup
  timer + `noise_emitted` investigate-draw), plus `KeycardDoor`/`LaserGrid`/`DisplayCase`/
  `ControllableLight`/`BreachPoint`/`MotionSensor`/`PressurePlate`/`BiometricLock`/`SilentAlarm`.
  **EventBus stayed frozen** (its contract test still passes) — zone power uses a `&"powered_device"`
  group + `power_zone`, loud actions reuse `alarm_tripped("loud")`/`noise_emitted`, readability uses
  local signals. **No magic numbers** — tunables live in `ObstacleDef`/`params`; added `lockpicking`/
  `hacking` `AttributeDef`s. **Task-05 handoff closed:** `EnemyDef.carried_item` + `inspector.tres` carry
  `&"vault_keycard"`, gating `keycard_door.tres` (FR-05-7). **Deferred (↩ notes added to the blocking
  docs):** minigame overlays → 07 (obstacles call the existing `Minigame` contract; the outcome is an
  input to the tested consequence seam — no fake solver), inventory/consumables/held-cards → 08,
  gadgets/weapons (glasscutter/stethoscope/EMP/cloner/breach charges/light-shoot) → 09/10, solution-set
  **consumption** + solvability + clue placement → 11 (FR-06-10), Intel reveal → 13. **Residual
  (`[~]`):** the F6 "feel" sign-off on `game/scenes/obstacles/ObstacleGreybox.tscn` (the fuse→camera/
  e-lock power-cut and the timed e-lock hack are operable now), mirroring tasks 03/04.
- **07 — Minigames:** **all six frameworks — code + automated DoD complete & verified green** on
  Godot 4.6.3 (headless GUT **148/148**, +36 task-07 tests). A `Minigame` (`Control`) base
  (`game/systems/minigames/`) + six subclasses — `LockpickMinigame` (rotate-to-arc + snap),
  `HackMinigame` (node-routing under a soft timer + proximity pause, non-modal), `SafeCrackMinigame`
  (dial clicks + wheels + stethoscope), `KeypadMinigame` (Mastermind deduction + found-code),
  `PickpocketMinigame` (timing meter), `DrillMinigame` (tension-manager overlay over `BreachPoint`) —
  each exposing its scalable maths as **pure static seams** (unit-tested) under thin code-built overlay
  glue; **keyboard + gamepad** via built-in `ui_*` actions (no InputMap edits), so FR-07-9 is met and
  EventBus stayed frozen. The base runs a clean lifecycle (`configure`→`begin`→`solved`/`failed`/`aborted`
  **once** via a `_finished` latch; optional world-pause; `ui_cancel` abort). **No magic numbers:** all
  tunables live in a new **`MinigameConfigDef`** (+ `default_minigame.tres`) registered as the **15th
  `Content` registry `Content.minigames`**; added the missing **`pickpocketing`** `AttributeDef`. A
  **`MinigameHost`** driver maps `kind → overlay` (a `preload`ed const map — bare `class_name`s aren't
  const-valid), injects difficulty (`obstacle.difficulty()`) + attribute (`TODO[12]`, 0 for now) + gear
  (`TODO[09]`, empty for now), and routes the outcome back through one polymorphic
  **`Obstacle.apply_minigame_result(kind, success)`**. **Obstacle wiring (closes the `↩ From 06` overlay
  slices):** `minigame_requested(kind)` was lifted to the `Obstacle` base; `Lock` (interact→lockpick),
  `Safe` (dial), `DisplayCase` (e-lock hack), and `HackTarget` **keypad** (Mastermind; e-locks/cameras
  keep their in-world proximity timer) now request overlays; `BreachPoint.interact` requests the drill
  gauge. The six task-06 obstacle consequence seams + their 112 tests stayed untouched. Dev greybox
  `game/scenes/minigames/MinigameGreybox.tscn` (+ reusable `MinigameHost.tscn`). **Deferred (↩ notes
  added to `05`/`11`):** the **pickpocket→NPC** attach point (needs a pickpockable civilian → 05.3
  roster / 11 population); the framework ships complete with `failed("caught")` as the suspicion hook.
  **Residual (`[~]`):** the F6 "feel" sign-off on `MinigameGreybox.tscn`, mirroring 03/04.
- **08 — Loot & Inventory:** **code + automated DoD complete & verified green** on Godot 4.6.3
  (headless GUT **178/178**, +30 task-08 tests). A new **`game/systems/inventory/`** domain:
  `Inventory` (`RefCounted`, owned by `PlayerController`) is the two-axis carry brain — weight/
  volume/hand-slot caps (`can_pick_up`), pocketable-vs-bagged pickup routing, key-item tracking,
  body-drag, throwing, and secure/lose bookkeeping — matching the pre-existing fixed-contract
  `test_carry_system.gd` exactly. **Correction during review:** a carried `Bag` occupies one hand
  slot (GDD §10.1 lists "gold bag" as a hand-slot example, not weightless-on-the-back), which
  makes carrying a bag and dragging a `Body` naturally mutually exclusive under the 2-slot cap
  with zero special-case code — `test_body_drag.gd` locks this in. `LootPickup`/`DropPoint`/
  `Escape` are `Interactable`s; `DropPoint.secure_from()`/`receive_bag()` are pure banking seams
  a real `ThrownBag` (`RigidBody3D`) physics landing and a headless test both call identically,
  so FR-08-4's throwing is fully unit-tested with **zero physics simulation**. **EventBus stayed
  frozen** — reuses the 4 pre-existing loot signals (`loot_picked_up`/`loot_secured`/
  `carry_changed`/`objective_updated`) exactly as declared; everything else (pickup-rejected
  feedback) is a local signal, matching `Obstacle.state_changed`/`Lock.pick_snapped`. **No magic
  numbers:** new carry tunables live on the existing `PlayerConfigDef` (a single directly-
  assigned resource, not Content-registered, matching how it's already used); a new
  `strength.tres` `AttributeDef`. `RunManager.add_notoriety`/new `add_take()` now do real base
  accumulation (`TODO[12]`/`TODO[14]` mark the multiplier/level-up/percentage enrichment those
  tasks still own — the precedent `Lock.resolve_attempt`'s `lockpicking_level` parameter already
  established); `ProgressionManager.add_to_stash()` backs FR-08-9. **Closed the task-05/06 duck-
  type hooks without touching any obstacle code:** `Obstacle.gd`/`BiometricLock.gd`/`Lock.gd`/
  `HackTarget.gd` were untouched except `HackTarget._complete()`'s one new `data_loot` branch —
  `PlayerController` grew `has_item()`/`is_carrying_keyholder()`/`add_loot()`, exactly the shape
  those duck-types were already calling. `Body` now `extends Interactable` (was bare `Node3D`) —
  a runtime-spawned body previously had no collider/mesh at all (confirmed via
  `GuardGreybox.tscn`'s decorative `Body0`, which also had none), so `_ready()` now builds a
  procedural collider always and a placeholder mesh only if a scene author hasn't placed one.
  Dev greybox `game/scenes/inventory/InventoryGreybox.tscn` (+ `InventoryGreyboxDebug.gd`, which
  also wires a real `PickPouch` to the greybox's `Lock`, closing that task-06 stand-in here).
  **Residual (`[~]`):** the F6 "feel" sign-off on `InventoryGreybox.tscn` — this session verified
  the scene loads cleanly headlessly (same baseline renderer noise as `ObstacleGreybox.tscn`) but
  could not drive interactive input; mark `[x]` after a human playtest pass, mirroring 04–07.
- **09 — Loadout, Gear & Gadgets:** **code + automated DoD complete & verified green** on Godot 4.6.3
  (headless GUT **200/200**, +22 task-09 tests). New domain **`game/systems/inventory/`'s sibling
  `game/systems/loadout/`**: `Loadout` (`RefCounted`, owned by `RunManager` via `RunManager.loadout()`,
  read by `PlayerController`) enforces per-slot capacity from a new **`LoadoutConfigDef`** (**16th
  `Content` registry `Content.loadout`**), research-gates equip against `ProgressionManager.unlocked_gear`,
  tracks consumable counts + `restock()` spending `RunManager.take`, exposes `gear_flags()` for the
  MinigameHost, and `validate()` + `to_dict()/from_dict()` (FR-09-8). `Weapon` + `Armor` are pure-ish
  models built from `GearDef.params` (extended with `tier`/`slot_cost`/`max_count`): weapon
  ammo/reload/recoil-spread/`attach()` mods + the **suppressed-vs-loud noise seam** (`fire()` emits the
  frozen `noise_emitted("gunshot")`, feeding 04); armor plate/overflow/regen + weight→`agility_mult`.
  **26 `GearDef` `.tres`** authored (tools, breach drill/thermite/C4, gadgets, weapons, suppressor mod,
  utility, apparel — **no Disguise Kit**, Q6; soft-soled gear's Silence bonus folds into footstep noise).
  Added a `marksmanship` `AttributeDef`. **EventBus stayed frozen** — loadout changes are a local
  `loadout_changed`; gunshots reuse `noise_emitted`. **Closed every `↩ From 06` gadget hook without
  touching obstacle consequence code:** `PlayerController.has_glasscutter()/can_clone_keycard()/
  has_biometric_spoof()` answer from the loadout, `MinigameHost._gear_params()` feeds stethoscope/
  hacking-rig, and a new **additive `BreachPoint.equip_tool()`** folds drill/thermite/C4 upgrade params
  (identity when no gear → the 112 task-06 tests unchanged; new `test_breach_gear.gd` locks it).
  **Deferred (↩ From 09 banners added to 10/11/13/16):** cover-shooter firing/damage-routing consuming
  the `Weapon`/`Armor` models → **10**; Armory/Fence/Workshop station UI → **13**; loadout↔`SaveManager`
  → **16**; found-as-loot + loadout-into-mission + active-throw gadgets → **11**; armor/ammo HUD → **15**.
  **Residual (`[~]`):** the 09 DoD's second bullet ("round-trips through save; weapons/armor feed 10")
  is blocked on 16/10 — the serialization itself round-trips + is tested. *(Update: "weapons/armor feed 10"
  half landed with task 10; only the `SaveManager` wiring is still blocked on 16.)*
- **10 — Going Loud, Combat & Pursuit:** **code + automated DoD complete & verified green** on Godot 4.6.3
  (headless GUT **222/222**, +22 task-10 tests). The going-loud escape gauntlet, built entirely on the
  **already-frozen EventBus** (`alarm_tripped`/`heat_changed`/`pursuit_phase_changed`/`streak_ended` all
  pre-declared — no signal changes). **Pursuit timeline:** a new mission-scoped `game/systems/pursuit/
  PursuitDirector.gd` arms on `alarm_tripped` and escalates phases 0→5 (GDD §8.6) off a response timer via
  **pure static seams** (`start_phase` — loud starts at 1, silent skips ahead; `next_phase`;
  `spawn_budget_for`; `tier_for`), re-emitting `pursuit_phase_changed` + a local
  `reinforcements_requested(tier, count)`. Tunables live in a new **`PursuitConfigDef`** (+
  `default_pursuit.tres`), the **17th `Content` registry `Content.pursuit`**. **Heat/commit (FR-10-3):**
  `RunManager` gained a `_ready` alarm listener + a real `raise_heat()` (clamp 0..1 + `heat_changed`) that
  sets `committed` and raises Heat by the config amount (loud > silent); the payout-multiplier +
  future-contract escalation stay `TODO[11]/TODO[12]`. **Combat core:** new `game/systems/combat/` —
  `Health` (`RefCounted`, pure-ish) routes damage **Armor→Health→DOWNED** with a self-revive window
  (→CAUGHT on lapse) and a **Capture / Get-Out-of-Jail** timing check (consumes the consumable on a pass →
  ESCAPED, else CAPTURED); pure seams `route_damage`/`is_down`/`skill_check_pass`. `PlayerCombat` (`Node3D`
  under `$Head/Hands`) builds live `Weapon`s from `Loadout.weapons()`, fires via camera hit-scan (reuses
  task-09 `Weapon.fire()`'s damage/spread/`noise_emitted("gunshot")` ring + `current_spread(marksmanship)`),
  with pure `blindfire_spread`/`suppressed_spread` seams. **PlayerController** now builds a `Health` pool
  (`PlayerConfigDef.health_base` × Health attr, + a new `Loadout.armor()` plate pool), applies
  `Armor.speed_mult()` to move speed, mounts `PlayerCombat`, exposes `apply_damage()`, and on CAUGHT/CAPTURED
  hands off to 12 (`RunManager.end_streak`) → `GameManager.goto_results` (FR-10-9). **Enemy escalation
  (closes Phase 05.4):** `GuardAI._tick_combat` replaced its converge-only stub with a fighting standoff
  (pure `combat_move_intent`/`should_fire`/`is_dead`) that fires `EnemyDef.loadout`'s Weapon at the player
  and takes `apply_damage` (downs → lethal `Body`). New `EnemyDef` tiers `responder`/`swat`/
  `specialist_shield`/`specialist_sniper` + an armed base guard (data, not id-branching). **Escape win
  (FR-10-8):** task-08 `Escape` banking already secures value on extraction (safe by construction). **No
  magic numbers** — all combat/pursuit tunables in `PursuitConfigDef`; added `health_base` to
  `PlayerConfigDef`. **Deferred (↩ From 10 banners added to 11/15):** reinforcement spawn **placement** +
  `Escape`→results transition → **11**; Pursuit/Heat + ammo/health/armor + Get-Out-of-Jail-bar HUD → **15**;
  Heat→payout-multiplier + the Legacy-conversion formula in `end_streak` → **12**. **F6 "feel" playtest
  signed off 2026-07-02** — going-loud/combat/pursuit verified inside `MissionGreybox.tscn` (`L`=go-loud →
  phases climb, `LMB` fires, reinforcements spawn, damage → Downed → Caught). **Task 10 complete (`[x]`).**
- **11 — Mission Generation:** **code + automated DoD (M1 *and* M2) complete & verified green** on Godot
  4.6.3 (headless GUT **245/245**, +23 task-11 tests). The **integration keystone** that stitches tasks
  04–10 into a fair/legible/solvable/seed-reproducible heist, built as **two stages** so the hard logic is
  headless-testable: `MissionGenerator.generate_layout(contract)` → a pure `MissionLayout` (a new
  **`game/systems/missiongen/`** domain: `MissionAssembler` grid-places sections **overlap-free by
  construction** with sockets matched-or-capped + one M2 cross-link loop; `MissionPopulator` scatters loot/
  patrols/camera-lock hazards/objective/keys/consumables/civilian under designer rules; `MissionBoard`
  builds the escalating 3–5-contract board), validated headlessly by **`MissionValidator`** — graph
  reachability entry→objective→escape + reachable Drop Point with a **key/clue fix-point** (the CI
  solvability gate; a key stranded behind its own door fails, so it's a real proof, not a rubber stamp).
  `build(contract)` **realizes** the layout into a **`MissionController`** (`game/scenes/mission/`) Node3D
  tree GameManager swaps in (procedural greybox floors + spawned guards/obstacles/loot/DropPoints/Escape +
  player). **Data-driven:** new **`SectionDef`** (footprint/socket_count/anchors) → **18th `Content` registry
  `Content.sections`** (`prefabs_meta/`, 6 Bank sections); new **`Contract`** (Resource, `to_dict/from_dict`
  save-ready for 16); `ArchetypeDef` gained id-reference pools (`section_ids`/`objective_ids`/`enemy_roster`/…);
  Bank fully authored + Museum/Warehouse (shared greybox sections pending art) + 8 objectives + 4 modifiers.
  The task-02 `sample_archetype_bank.json` scaffold was superseded by real `.tres` archetypes (removed from
  the scan). **EventBus stayed frozen** — reuses `objective_updated`/`loot_secured`/`mission_completed`/
  `alarm_tripped` + local signals. **Closed the deferred ↩ hooks:** `Escape`→`goto_results` +
  `PursuitDirector.reinforcements_requested`→spawn at reinforce anchors (10); `Obstacle.solution_set()`/
  `difficulty()` consumed for solvability (06, FR-06-10); `MinigameHost.attach_all` over built obstacles (07);
  consumables found-as-loot + `Loadout.validate()` pre-mission in `GameManager.enter_mission` (09); the three
  `PlayerController` thrown/dropped-body spawns now parent under the `&"mission_root"` group (closed its
  TODO[11]); `RunManager.start_new_streak()`→`refresh_board()`. **Deferred (refreshed ↩ notes, per scope):**
  deep **05.3** AI roster behaviors (dogs/operator/civilian-wander — the civilian ships as a pickpockable
  keycard marker) + **05.5** perf profiling; real art prefabs → **18**; daily/seeded contracts → **20**; Job
  Map UI → **13/15**; Heat→payout-multiplier → **12**. **F6 "feel" playtest signed off 2026-07-02**
  (`game/scenes/mission/MissionGreybox.tscn` — a generated Bank plays end to end: slip a cone, clone the
  vault gate, bag loot → Drop Point, Escape). **Task 11 complete (`[x]`).** **Playtest fixes:** the first walk
  surfaced legibility/affordance
  gaps in the greybox *realization* (not the generator) — fixed: guards now render **blue capsules + a
  `DetectionConeDebug` wedge** (the Inspector/keycard-carrier is **gold**), the civilian is a distinct cyan
  box, section tiles ramp blue→amber (no longer clashing with the red Escape), and high-security wings
  reliably get a camera. `MissionGreyboxDebug` now **equips a dev Loadout** (suppressed pistol + keycard
  cloner + lockpick + emp/smoke) so `fire`/gadgets/the **vault keycard door** (opens via the cloner) are
  testable, adds a **debug HUD** (carry / secured / alert / pursuit + a controls cheat-sheet — the real HUD
  is task 15) and an **L = force go-loud** dev key. Also **closed a genuine task-05 wire**: the `takedown`
  input action (default **V**) had **no consumer** — `PlayerController._update_takedown_input()` now drops
  the nearest guard you're facing via the existing `GuardAI.take_down(false)` (leaves a concealable Body
  with the carried keycard). Controls: **F** interact/pick-up · **V** takedown · **T** throw bag · **G**
  drop body · **LMB** fire · **1** weapon · **4** gadget.
- **12 — Progression: Streak & Legacy:** **code + automated DoD complete & verified green** on Godot
  4.6.3 (headless GUT **270/270**, +25 task-12 tests). The roguelite engine, data-driven end to end and
  built on the **already-frozen EventBus** (`notoriety_gained`/`streak_level_up`/`streak_ended` were
  pre-declared + contract-locked — no signal changes). **Config:** a new **`ProgressionConfigDef`**
  (+ `default_progression.tres`), the **19th `Content` registry `Content.progression`**, owns every
  curve (Streak-Level thresholds, performance-bonus fractions, Heat→payout slope, `legacy_floor`, Edge
  rarity weights) — no magic numbers. **`RunManager`** gained the Streak brain as **pure static seams**
  (`level_for_notoriety`, `stack_multiplier`, `draw_edges`, `heat_multiplier_for`, `convert_to_legacy`)
  under thin glue: `add_notoriety` applies held-Edge `notoriety_mult` then draws **1-of-3** Edges on a
  level-up; a new `mission_completed` listener banks objective NP × the performance multiplier
  (no-alarm/stealth from RunManager's own per-mission `alarm_tripped`/`player_spotted` tracking, +
  no-kill/full-clear/speed from the MissionController summary) and bumps `streak_length`; `raise_heat`
  now feeds `heat_multiplier()`; **`end_streak`** converts `Notoriety × Heat-mult → Legacy` (floored),
  banks it via `ProgressionManager.add_legacy`, emits `streak_ended`, records lifetime stats, and resets
  the Streak (FR-12-1..4/9). Held Edges are queried via `edge_modifier_total(key)` and vanish on the
  Catch. **`ProgressionManager`** gained the Legacy sinks: `train_attribute` (spends the `AttributeDef`
  cost curve, raises the level; `attribute_effect` = level × per-level feeds systems) + Legacy Perks
  (`buy_perk`/`can_buy_perk`, prereq + cost gated, permanent, idempotent) + `perk_modifier_total`.
  **Content:** **20 `EdgeDef`** (rarity-tiered GDD §5.1 roster: Silent Hands / Ghost / Mule / Fence
  Connections / …), **8 `PerkDef`** (with a prereq chain nimble→ghost_protocol, thick_skin→juggernaut,
  →legend), and cost curves on all **14** GDD §5.5 attributes (added health/armor/speed/sneak/
  carry_weight/carry_volume/perception). **Closed the deferred `TODO[12]` hooks** (↩ From 06/07/10):
  the Heat→payout multiplier + Legacy-conversion formula in `end_streak`; MinigameHost/Minigame attribute
  injection now returns real levels; `Lock.apply_minigame_result` eases the pick-snap by trained
  Lockpicking (level from ProgressionManager, per-level reduction from the `AttributeDef` — no magic
  numbers). Updated the task-10 `test_secured_safe_on_loud_catch` to the now-real conversion (its own
  comment had deferred it here). **Deferred (↩ notes, per scope):** Take = %-of-cash + the full Notoriety
  economy pass → **14**; per-system consumption of every Edge/Perk *effect* → per-system polish; the
  Hideout **spend** UI → **13**. **Residual (`[~]`):** the M1 "felt" full-loop is the M1 milestone gate
  (needs the Hideout spend UI (13) + menu/save (15/16)) — **not task 12 alone**; the
  Streak→Catch→conversion→board-escalation half is F6-testable in `MissionGreybox.tscn` today. **Task 12
  code-complete (`[x]`).**
- **13 — Hideout & Stations:** **code + automated DoD (M1 *and* M3) complete & verified green** on Godot
  4.6.3 (headless GUT **295/295**, +25 task-13 tests). The between-mission hub, built **manifest-driven**:
  a new **`game/systems/hideout/HideoutManifest.gd`** builds the station list purely from `Content.stations`
  + `ProgressionManager` unlock state, so a `StationDef` .tres + a panel scene = a new station with **no
  code edit** (FR-13-1, proven by `test_station_manifest` — the station-level mirror of FR-02-5). **Manager
  seams (pure static, headless-tested):** `ProgressionManager` gained station unlock (`is/try_unlock_station`
  + `can_unlock_station` — Legacy **or** delivered-special-loot gate), Workshop `research_gear` (+
  `can_research`, optional `params["research_prereq"]`), Fence `convert_stash_item` (+ `convert_value`), and
  `stash_set_bonus_total` (the "read by 12" set-bonus seam); `RunManager` gained the Planning-Table Intel
  line — `buy_intel`/`has_intel`/`revealed_modifiers` keyed by `mission_seed`, hiding a contract's modifiers/
  manifest until bought (FR-13-3/8). **UI:** a **2D `Hideout.tscn`** hub (manifest grid + unlock buttons +
  currency header) + a `StationPanel` base and **8 panels** in `game/scenes/hideout/stations/` (Job Map,
  Training, Workshop, Armory, Legacy Board, Planning Table, Stash, Fence) that thin-wrap already-tested
  manager methods; **plus** a 3D furnished **`HideoutGreybox.tscn`** demo (Phase-1 **Quaternius** furniture +
  a **Casual** character; FP walk WASD+mouselook, `[F]` a station prop → the *same* panel overlay; locked
  props show a red placard and turn green when unlocked — "the safehouse visibly grows"). **EventBus stayed
  frozen** — panels use direct manager calls + local `closed`/`loadout_changed` signals. **Content:** **8
  `StationDef`** (`job_map`/`training`/`workshop` free; `armory`/`legacy_board`/`planning_table`/`fence`
  Legacy-gated; `stash` **loot-gated** on delivering `stash_trophy_painting`) + **3 `IntelDef`**; `LootDef`
  gained a `params` field (Stash `set_bonus`) and `IntelDef` gained `description`/`legacy_cost`. `GameManager`
  New Game/Continue now land in the Hideout (FR-13-11; real save I/O stays `TODO[16]`). **Closed the deferred
  hooks:** `↩ From 06` (Intel reveal → Planning Table), `↩ From 09.1/09.2` (Armory/Workshop/Fence front-ends),
  `↩ From 12` (Training/Legacy-Board front-ends over `train_attribute`/`buy_perk`). **Deferred (per scope):**
  Take-scaling on Intel/Fence → **14**; first-time hints → **22**; loadout/progression↔`SaveManager` → **16**.
  **F6 "feel" playtest signed off 2026-07-04** (hub + all 8 panels + the 3D `HideoutGreybox.tscn` demo;
  headless instantiation of every scene is also smoke-tested by `test_hideout_scenes.gd`) — **Task 13
  complete (`[x]`).** The **M1 milestone gate** itself still needs **15** (menu/HUD) + **16** (save) before
  it's met.
- **14 — Economy & Balancing:** **code + automated DoD (M2 wiring *and* M3 tuning) complete & verified
  green** on Godot 4.6.3 (headless GUT **311/311**, +15 task-14 tests). The three-currency economy, wired
  then *tuned*, built on the **already-frozen EventBus** (reuses `loot_secured`/`notoriety_gained`/
  `heat_changed`/`streak_ended` — no signal changes). **Config:** a new **`EconomyConfigDef`** — the **20th
  `Content` registry `Content.economy`** — is the central balance table, authored **only** as hot-editable
  **`game/data/economy.json`** (loaded via the existing `ContentRegistry` JSON path proven by
  `sample_loot.json`; `resolve()` falls back to schema defaults so headless seams never crash). Owns the
  Take fraction, the Notoriety `bonus_*` multipliers, the Heat→payout slope, the `legacy_floor`, the catch
  model + target bands — no magic numbers. **This is the `↩ From 12` handoff:** task 14 took over the
  economy dials; `ProgressionConfigDef` keeps the streak *structure* (level thresholds, Edge weights).
  **FR-14-2 (Take = %):** `DropPoint.bank()` now banks Notoriety=**full** street value but Take=only the
  `take_fraction` cut (pure seam `EconomyConfigDef.take_cut`); `add_take`'s `TODO[14]` resolved (it stays a
  pure passthrough — the Fence + restock refunds bank their own values; the Fence honours `fence_fraction`).
  **FR-14-3:** `RunManager._econ()` sources the dials; `_on_mission_completed`/`heat_multiplier`/`end_streak`
  read it. `stack_multiplier(flags, cfg)`'s `cfg` was **relaxed to duck-typed** so both `EconomyConfigDef`
  (runtime) and `ProgressionConfigDef` (task-12 tests) work — task-12 pure-seam tests stayed green (they use
  `.new()` defaults). **FR-14-4:** new **`EconomyValidator`** (pure static) range-checks every per-item cost
  `.tres` (loot value / gear research+restock / attribute curves monotonic+sized / perk cost+prereqs / Intel
  prices) **+** the economy dials; `test_data_tables_valid` asserts zero violations and proves it's *not* a
  rubber stamp. Per-item costs stay `.tres` (validated, not migrated) — the user-chosen JSON scope.
  **FR-14-6:** new **`EconomySimulator`** (Monte-Carlo, CLEAN vs LOUD cohorts, seeded/headless) reuses the
  real payout seams (`stack_multiplier`/`heat_multiplier_for`/`convert_to_legacy`) so editing `economy.json`
  moves the sim too; reports Streak-length distribution + Legacy/run + a clean/loud ratio. **FR-14-5
  (stealth-favored tuning, per the user's "not intended to be loud"):** `take_fraction 0.35`, modest
  `heat_multiplier_slope 0.5`, steep `catch_per_heat 0.55`; harness (20k runs/cohort) → **clean mean 4.47
  contracts / ~35.3k Legacy** vs **loud 1.51 / ~13.8k → 2.55× ratio**, min payout = the floor, every Catch
  affords the cheapest Training buy. Intel re-priced to the new Take reality (manifest 1200 / modifiers 1800
  / silent_alarms 2400) so casing stays usable on a clean run. Also **closed a task-12 leftover:** the
  `financier` Perk's `legacy_conversion_mult` is now consumed in `end_streak` (updated the two task-12/08
  tests whose expectations the new Take-% + Heat-slope shifted — like task 12 updated task 10's). **Greybox
  `game/scenes/economy/EconomyGreybox.tscn`** (+ `EconomyGreyboxDebug.gd`) — an FP Economy Sandbox using
  **real heist props** (`safe.glb`) + **Quaternius furniture**: a Vault secures cash (watch the
  Notoriety-full / Take-fraction split live), the five spend-station props open the real `StationPanel`s, and
  dev keys drive the flow (`[H]` silent alarm → Heat↑, `[C]` complete clean contract, `[K]` get Caught →
  convert, `[B]` balancing-harness readout with an ASCII Streak-length histogram). **Deferred (↩):**
  in-mission Take/Heat HUD → **15**; economy↔`SaveManager` → **16**; daily/seeded balance presets → **20**.
  **F6 "feel" playtest signed off 2026-07-04** (headless instantiation of `EconomyGreybox.tscn` is also
  smoke-tested by `test_economy_scenes.gd`) — **Task 14 complete (`[x]`).** The **M2/M3 milestone gates**
  still need their other spanned tasks before they're met.
- **15 — UI/UX, HUD & Menus:** **code + automated DoD complete & verified green** on Godot 4.6.3 (headless
  GUT **331/331**, +20 task-15 tests). All UI is **code-built** (the `Hideout.gd`/`StationPanel.gd` house
  pattern) behind a shared **`UITheme`** (`game/scenes/ui/UITheme.gd`) that assembles a `Theme` from the
  **Kenney Future font + `ui/kit_rpg` 9-slice textures** with flat fallbacks, plus a shared palette (incl.
  the grey→yellow→orange→red detection band). *(Superseded by the misc-fixes-2 pass below: body text is now
  Godot's readable built-in sans + flat understated-outline styleboxes; KenneyFuture stays on large headings
  via `UITheme.style_title()`.)* **Menus (Phase 15.1):** rebuilt **`MainMenu`** (exactly four
  items; Continue disabled via the pure seam `MainMenu.continue_enabled(count)`; Exit via `ConfirmPopup`)
  routes New Game/Continue into a shared **`SlotPopup`** (`NEW`/`LOAD`; each row renders
  `SaveManager.slot_summary()` through the pure `SlotPopup.format_slot()` → five fields / "Empty";
  Overwrite + per-slot Delete confirmed). **Full Options (Phase 15.3, FR-15-4):** **`Options.gd`**
  `TabContainer` — Graphics/Audio/**Controls (live KB+M & gamepad remap** over `InputManager.ACTIONS` →
  `InputManager.rebind_action`)/Gameplay-Accessibility/System — every control reads/writes
  `SettingsManager.get_value/set_value` (already live-applies + persists); **`SettingsManager.DEFAULTS`
  extended to the full GDD §15.2 schema** (render_scale/shadows/fov/gamma/motion_blur/camera_shake, ui/
  ambience/subtitles, colorblind/reduce_flashing/aim_assist/vibration/language) with `render_scale` applied
  to the viewport + `fov` pushed to the player camera on `settings_changed`. **HUD (Phase 15.2/15.4,
  Q1):** **`HUD.gd`** (`CanvasLayer`, `PROCESS_MODE_ALWAYS`) mounts the **combined `CompassEye`** — an eye
  that fills grey→red with the strongest detection meter, ringed by a directional tick that points at the
  most-alarming guard (resolved via `instance_from_id(actor_id)` on the frozen `detection_changed`), with a
  redundant state **symbol** so it's not colour-only (FR-15-7) — plus carry (W/V vs caps + FULL), objective +
  **secured-vs-remaining** (new `MissionController.loot_total_value()`), a Pursuit/Heat strip, and a **loud
  block** (health/armor/ammo) gated by the pure `HUD.loud_visible()`; an **on-world `NoiseRingSpawner`**
  draws the noise ring (FR-15-5). The HUD is mounted by `MissionController.realize()` (the
  `MissionGreyboxDebug` stand-in label was trimmed to a bottom controls cheat-sheet). **Pause + results:**
  **`PauseMenu`** (owned by the HUD via the `pause` action; pauses the tree, frees the mouse) surfaces the
  **Q5 commit messaging** — a clean bug-out (uncommitted) returns to the Hideout keeping loot/Streak, but
  once `RunManager.committed` leaving resolves as the **Catch** (`end_streak` → results); **`MissionResults.gd/
  .tscn`** (the path `GameManager.MISSION_RESULTS_SCENE` already referenced) summarizes the escape/Catch +
  Legacy payout from a new `GameManager.pending_results` dict (fed by `PlayerController._on_health_state_changed`
  on a Catch). **EventBus stayed frozen** — reuses `detection_changed`/`pursuit_phase_changed`/`heat_changed`
  + local signals; no new signals. **Demo greybox `game/scenes/ui/UISandbox.tscn`** (+ `UISandboxDebug.gd`)
  — a furnished FP room from **real imported assets** (`furniture_quaternius/*.obj` + `props/heist/safe.glb`
  + `characters/Swat.gltf` as the compass "threat" + `Casual.gltf`) with a **real PlayerController** + the
  real HUD, and dev keys driving every readout (J detection · B carry · H go-loud · P pursuit · K damage · N
  noise ring) + opening every menu (O Options · U/I slot popups · Y/L results · M Main Menu). **Deferred (↩
  From 15 → 16, per the user's decision to build 15 against SaveManager's seams):** the menu/slots' **live
  save data** (SlotPopup/MainMenu already call `scan_slots`/`slot_summary`/`save_slot`/`load_slot`/
  `delete_slot`, all stubs → Continue greyed + slots "Empty" on a fresh profile; lights up with no UI edit
  once 16 lands) + the two save-backed integration tests. **F6 "feel" sign-off passed 2026-07-05** —
  compass-eye fills grey→red + points at threats, carry/objective-secured/pursuit-heat/loud readouts live,
  noise ring visible, all menus functional, Options persist, Pause Q5 messaging, Results correct, HUD renders
  in `MissionGreybox.tscn`. **Task 15 complete (`[x]`).** The **M1 milestone gate** still needs task 16.
- **16 — Save System:** **code + automated DoD complete & verified green** on Godot 4.6.3 (headless GUT
  **343/343**, +12 task-16 tests). The strict-integrity roguelite persistence layer. `SaveManager` writes
  one JSON file per slot under `user://saves/` with **atomic write-then-rename** (`_write_atomic`: fill
  `.tmp` → clear target → `rename_absolute`), header validation, and a `JSON`-instance `parse()` so a
  corrupt slot reads as empty **without** logging an engine error (the quiet-corruption path GUT would
  otherwise flag). The save schema (`SCHEMA_VERSION = 2`) is composed from new **`to_dict()/from_dict()`**
  seams on `ProgressionManager` (the permanent block + a new persistent `playtime_seconds`) and
  `RunManager` (the Streak block — folding in the pre-existing `Loadout.to_dict()` and `Contract.to_dict()`
  serializers + `intel_by_seed` with int→string key coercion for JSON); StringName id arrays/dicts round
  through String via shared `_sn_array_to_str`/`_str_array_to_sn` helpers on ProgressionManager.
  **Strict integrity (Q5, FR-16-5):** a **top-level `active_mission_committed` checkpoint flag** — kept
  distinct from the normal `streak.committed` Heat state so a safe hub save is never misread as a Catch —
  is flipped **on-disk** the instant an alarm trips (`RunManager._on_alarm_tripped` → `SaveManager.
  mark_committed()`, the one allowed mid-mission disk touch: one-way, un-save-scummable, no progress
  stored). `load_slot` resolving that flag runs `end_streak("caught_hot_quit")` (converts Notoriety→Legacy,
  resets the Streak) and re-persists the cleared slot, so a hot-quit costs the run and a second load is a
  plain continue (no double Catch). **Autosave** (`GameManager.goto_hideout` arrival, `start_new_game`
  fresh-slot persist, `Hideout._on_panel_closed`/`_unlock_station` per-transaction) only ever fires
  **between missions** — no mid-mission save-scumming. **Migration:** the `migrate()` stepwise loop +
  `_migrate_1_to_2` (defaults the two v2-new fields) + version stamping. **EventBus stayed frozen** —
  no signal changes; the persistence layer reads the `ProgressionManager`/`RunManager` globals to
  snapshot/restore. **Closed the deferred hooks with no UI edits:** the `↩ From 15` live-save data
  (SlotPopup/MainMenu already called the seams → Continue enables + slots render the five fields on a real
  save; `test_save_menu_integration.gd`) and the `↩ From 09` loadout↔save DoD bullet (the equipped set +
  consumable counts survive save/load via the Streak block). Demo: `game/scenes/menu/SaveSandbox.tscn`
  (+ `SaveSandboxDebug.gd`) — a menu-flow sandbox (the user's chosen form over a bespoke 3D room): a live
  10-slot readout via the real `SlotPopup.format_slot`/`SaveManager.slot_summary` seams, dev keys for
  save/load/delete/select, a `[C]` hot-quit→Catch simulation and a `[G]` v1→v2 migration round-trip, and
  `[N]/[O]` opening the real MainMenu/SlotPopup. **F6 "feel" playtest signed off 2026-07-05** (Continue
  restores a slot exactly; a hot-quit costs the run) — **Task 16 complete (`[x]`)**. With 16 landed, the
  **M1 milestone gate is met** (every spanned task + the manual checklist).
- **17 — Audio:** **code + automated DoD complete & verified green** on Godot 4.6.3 (headless GUT
  **356/356**, +13 task-17 tests). Two pillars — dynamic music + diegetic/positional SFX — built on the
  **frozen EventBus** (no signal changes): `AudioManager` *subscribes* to the existing globals and adds a
  local `caption_requested` signal (EventBus stays signals-only). **Music (FR-17-1):** four looped
  **procedural placeholder beds** (`AudioStreamWAV` additive-harmonic drones, rising partial count/pitch
  per state — user chose placeholder-now over silent-framework) crossfade on the Music bus via a pure
  static `music_state_for(detection_state, pursuit_phase)` seam + a per-actor detection aggregator
  (`_actor_states`, pruned on UNAWARE) + latest pursuit phase; `mission_completed`/`streak_ended` latch
  **Resolve**, `game_state_changed` resets to Calm. **SFX (FR-17-2, user chose approximate-from-CC0):**
  every cue is mapped from the imported **Kenney CC0** interface/impact set via a new data-driven
  **`AudioConfigDef`** (+ `default_audio.tres`), the **21st `Content` registry `Content.audio`** (static
  `resolve()`); EventBus-global cues (spotted/alarm-by-kind/loot/body/footstep) are handled in
  AudioManager, and **local-signal sites call `play_sfx` directly** (EventBus untouched): `Lock`
  (pick-snap), `BreachPoint` (a `play_loop` running-drill + jam/done), `HackTarget`/`HackMinigame`
  (tick/fault/done), `GuardAI.take_down`. `play_sfx(id, position)` routes a transient
  `AudioStreamPlayer3D` when given a Vector3 else a 2D player; `_last_sfx_id` is the test seam.
  **Positional (FR-17-3):** player footsteps off `noise_emitted(source=="footstep")`; `GuardAI` emits a
  cadence-driven 3D footstep (per-instance throttle) so an approaching guard is locatable by ear.
  **Buses (FR-17-4):** added the missing **Ambience** bus to `default_bus_layout.tres` — the five Options
  sliders were already wired via `SettingsManager._apply_audio`/`_set_bus_linear`. **Captions (FR-17-7):**
  a HUD caption line (`MissionHUD`) fed by `AudioManager.caption_requested`, gated on the existing
  `audio.subtitles` setting (generation-token auto-clear). **Grounded palette (FR-17-5)** — CC0 diegetic
  sounds, no supernatural motifs. **Manifest/CREDITS/ART-TODO (FR-17-6)** updated with the procedural-bed
  + approximated-SFX placeholders and their real-asset replacements. Demo:
  `game/scenes/audio/AudioSandbox.tscn` (+ `AudioSandboxDebug.gd`) — an FP room (Quaternius furniture +
  `safe.glb` + a patrolling `Swat.gltf`) with dev keys to cycle detection (hear Calm→Tense→Combat
  crossfade), bump pursuit, fire each cue, locate the guard by footsteps, toggle Subtitles, and mute the
  Music bus. **M2 manual F6 sign-off 2026-07-05** (tell calm/tense/combat apart + locate a guard by
  footsteps); real music stems + bespoke SFX are noted pending in ART-TODO — **Task 17 complete (`[x]`).**
- **18 — Art & Asset Pipeline (first M2 pass):** **code + automated DoD complete & verified green** on Godot
  4.6.3 (headless GUT **98/98**, +2 art tests; `check_assets.sh` green). Turns the greybox world into a
  dressed, cohesive one for the **M2 Bank slice** by wiring the previously-**dormant art `scene` seam** into
  gameplay — additively, so the 356 existing tests + un-dressed archetypes stay green. **Master materials
  (FR-18-2):** a new **`Palette`** static accessor (`game/systems/art/Palette.gd`) over **10
  `StandardMaterial3D` .tres** in `game/assets/materials/` (empty before) — one grounded, stealth-readable
  palette + role tints, flat fallback so it never hard-fails (the `UITheme` philosophy). **The seam
  (data, not code):** `MissionController` now realizes `SectionDef.scene` (new **`SectionShell`** — a
  code-built, grid-snapped `footprint × CELL` room with a doorway on **every** edge so it can't fight the
  assembler's socket orientation; authored for **vault + entry_lobby**, others fall back to a
  master-materialed tile), a new **`ObstacleDef.scene`** (prop prefabs → vault door / camera / safe /
  server), the pre-existing **`LootDef.mesh`** (cash/gold/painting/diamond `.glb` over an invisible collider
  so the interaction ray still resolves), and a new **`EnemyDef.model`** (real Quaternius characters — one
  shared rig, FR-18-5 — over the kept capsule collider + detection cone + a **tinted feet-ring** so
  blue-guard / gold-keycarrier / cyan-civilian threats stay legible). Plus a **WorldEnvironment + key/fill
  lighting** pass (skipped when a scene ships its own, e.g. `MissionGreybox.tscn`). Standalone showcase
  `bank_test.tscn` recolored to the palette + a guard read-ring. **Tooling (FR-18-1/3/6):**
  `tools/scripts/check_assets.sh` (mirrors `check_docs.sh`) fails CI on a missing manifest row / non-LFS
  binary / stale row (batched `git check-attr --stdin` — per-file was too slow on Windows); wired into
  `ci.yml`; standards documented in `ASSET_PIPELINE.md`. LFS/import were already healthy (`.gitattributes`
  + per-kit `.import` root_scale). **Interaction preserved:** the ray walks parents to the `Interactable`,
  and prop prefabs are `StaticBody3D` on layer 1 exactly like the old markers, so obstacle/loot pickup is
  unchanged. **Deferred (↩ logged in `ART-TODO.md`):** section shells for the other 4 Bank sections +
  Museum/Warehouse; per-tier actor variants; loot-model scale pass; grounded prop replacements (vault
  door/laser/sensors still CC0 stand-ins). **F6 cohesion/readability sign-off passed 2026-07-05**
  (`MissionGreybox.tscn` / `bank_test.tscn` / `gallery_hub.tscn`) — **Task 18 first pass complete (`[x]`).**
  (Phase 18.4 upkeep stays ongoing per import; the **M2 gate** itself still needs 06/07/09's own residuals.)
- **19 — Expansion Framework:** **code + automated DoD complete & verified green** on Godot 4.6.3
  (headless GUT **381/381**, +13 task-19 tests; `tools/scripts/validate_content.sh` exits 0 on base
  content). Hardens the "expansions ship as data, not code" promise — thin additive glue over the
  already-data-driven registry spine (task 02), plus one worked-example pack. **Content packs (19.3,
  FR-19-4):** new pure-static **`PackManager`** (`game/systems/content/`, no 11th autoload — the
  architecture stays at 10) discovers `res://game/packs/<id>/pack.json` manifests, tracks enable state in
  **`user://packs.json`** (deliberately outside the 10 save slots — a disabled pack can never brick a
  slot), and exposes `tres_dirs_for(key)`/`json_files_for(key)`. **`Content._make`** appends those to each
  registry's scan dirs (core folder stays index 0 → **add-only**, first-writer-wins — a pack can't
  silently override a base id); a new **`Content.reload()`** rebuilds everything live on toggle.
  **`ContentRegistry` itself needed zero changes** — it already looped multiple `tres_dirs`/`json_files`
  and tracked `duplicate_ids`. **Content validator (19.2, FR-19-3):** new pure-static **`ContentValidator`**
  — a superset of `EconomyValidator` (calls + merges it for the value/cost/curve ranges) driven by two
  declarative consts, `REQUIRED` and `REFERENCES` (registry key → fields → target registry), so it
  branches on a def's *property* + target type, never an id: checks every id is present/unique
  (`duplicate_ids`)/`lowercase_snake`, required fields are filled, and cross-references resolve
  (`ArchetypeDef`'s six id-pools, `EnemyDef.loadout`, `PursuitConfigDef.tier_ladder` — skipping empty
  "none" sentinels like phase-0's `tier_ladder[0]`; free-form key-item ids like `vault_keycard` and the
  `unlock_special_loot`→`special_hook` gate are intentionally excluded, they're not registry ids). Shipped
  as a CLI (`tools/scripts/validate_content.sh` → headless `tools/godot/ContentValidateMain.gd`), an
  in-editor `@tool` (`tools/godot/ValidateContentEditor.gd`, validates a transient `Content` so it works
  without game autoloads), and a new `ci.yml` step. **Forward-compat saves (19.6, FR-19-6):** the
  user-chosen policy is **preserve-but-dormant** — an audit found `ProgressionManager.from_dict`/
  `RunManager.from_dict`/`Loadout.from_dict` already restore ids verbatim and every consumer already uses
  the assign-then-`if def != null` idiom (matching `StationPanel`/`ArmoryStation`/`FenceStation`), so a
  disabled pack's unlocks/perks/stations/edges stay dormant in the save and **fully revive on re-enable**
  with **zero code changes, no stripping, and no `SCHEMA_VERSION` bump**. New read-only
  **`SaveReconcile.unknown_ids()`** *reports* which restored ids don't currently resolve (for the sandbox
  readout + `test_pack_toggle`) — it never mutates. **Authoring kit (19.1, FR-19-2/5):** three new docs —
  `docs/AUTHORING.md` (a "how to add a new ___" row per content type, using the real `.tres` as samples,
  not a parallel template set that would drift), `docs/PREFAB_AUTHORING.md` (the `SectionDef`
  socket/anchor contract — footprint in 6 m cells, the `Kind` enum, the seven anchor types, the
  `scene=null`→`SectionShell` fallback, and the `MissionBoard.is_generatable` minimum-viable-archetype
  checklist), and `docs/CONTENT_PACKS.md` (pack folder/manifest format, add-only semantics, the
  `user://`-mod import caveat for a future step). **Worked example (19.4, FR-19-7):**
  **`game/packs/estate_job/`** — "The Estate Job," a Private Estate night-burglary pack shipped entirely
  as data + scenes: an `estate` `ArchetypeDef` (reusing existing objectives/enemies/loot so it needs no
  new gameplay code), **4 new `SectionDef`** (`estate_foyer`/`estate_study`/`estate_servants`/
  `estate_grounds`/`estate_gallery` — all `scene=null` so `SectionShell` renders them, exercising FR-19-5
  through the pack itself and satisfying `is_generatable`'s ENTRY/INTERIOR/OBJECTIVE/ESCAPE checklist), **3
  `EdgeDef`** reusing real modifier keys read by `RunManager.edge_modifier_total`
  (`shadow_fill_mult`/`footstep_noise_mult`/`notoriety_mult`), **`estate_snips`** `GearDef` reusing the
  `glasscutter` capability flag (`params.gadget_flag`) so it opens display cases via the existing
  `PlayerController.has_glasscutter()` hook with zero new code, and a **`locksmith`** `StationDef` + its
  own `LocksmithPanel.tscn/gd` (`extends StationPanel`, mirrors the Fence's `Loadout.restock` idiom) —
  proving FR-19-7 honestly (a real station-specific scene, not a bare reuse) while still requiring no
  edit to `HideoutManifest` or any central switch. Ships **disabled by default**
  (`pack.json.default_enabled: false`) so the base game and all prior tests are unperturbed until a
  player/test opts in. **Demo:** `game/scenes/expansion/ExpansionSandbox.tscn` (+
  `ExpansionSandboxDebug.gd`, registered in `GalleryHub`) — an FP room dressed with real Quaternius
  furniture + `props/heist/*` (safe/display-case/painting) + a `characters/Casual.gltf` NPC: `[P]` toggles
  the shipped pack and the live `Content.<reg>.size()` counts jump with **no code change**; `[V]` runs
  `ContentValidator.validate()` and shows the report; `[G]` grants the pack's unlocks (as a save would
  hold them) so toggling the pack off then demonstrates the dormant-id count going up and back to zero on
  re-enable; the Locksmith prop opens the pack's own panel. The sandbox isolates its toggles to
  `user://packs_sandbox.json` and restores clean global state on exit, so it never perturbs the real game
  or other tests. **EventBus stayed frozen** — pack toggles are direct calls, validation is pure static, no
  new signals. **F6 "feel" playtest signed off 2026-07-06** (`ExpansionSandbox.tscn`) — toggle/validate/
  dormant-revive all verified interactively. **Task 19 complete (`[x]`).**
- **20 — Progression Milestones & Live Content:** **code + automated DoD complete & verified green** on Godot
  4.6.3 (headless GUT **407/407**, +26 task-20 tests; `validate_content.sh` green). The first **M4 "live"**
  list, built entirely as **data/config over the frozen EventBus + the 10-autoload spine** (new logic is
  pure-static helpers, mirroring task 19's `PackManager`). **Decisions (user):** daily/weekly = standalone
  Challenge mode; milestones auto-unlock for free; seasonal rewards = Legacy + a dormant title id; live config
  = a local JSON manifest (no networking). **Milestones (FR-20-1):** a new **`MilestoneDef`** (**22nd `Content`
  registry `Content.milestones`**, pack-extensible; 5 base arcs) + `ProgressionManager.check_milestones()`
  **auto-grants stations/gear/archetypes for free** at a lifetime-Legacy-earned / delivered-special-loot
  threshold (pure seam `milestones_satisfied`), banks an optional `reward_legacy`, and announces via a new
  **local `milestone_unlocked` signal** (EventBus frozen) → the Hideout drains a toast on entry (every mission
  end routes through the hub, so it's kept OUT of `end_streak`/`add_to_stash` — no payout side-effects).
  Milestone-gated **maps** via a new additive `ArchetypeDef.unlock_milestone` threaded through
  `MissionBoard.generatable_archetypes`/`MissionGenerator.refresh_board`/`RunManager.refresh_board`
  (`unlocked_archetypes`; empty gate + empty set keeps every task-11 board test green). **Live systems
  (`game/systems/live/`, no 11th autoload):** pure-static **`LiveOps`** reads `game/data/liveops.json`
  DIRECTLY as a raw Dictionary (remote-tolerant) and owns date→seed (**self-rolled stable FNV-1a**, not
  Godot's `hash()`, so a daily is identical across machines), `active_modifiers` (a day-bucket rotation ring),
  `active_season`, and `challenge_contract`; **`LiveChallenges`** keeps local best time/score in
  `user://challenge_results.json` (outside save slots). **Daily/weekly Challenges (FR-20-2) are STANDALONE:**
  `GameManager.enter_challenge` → `RunManager.begin_challenge` snapshots the Streak via `to_dict()`, runs on a
  clean scratch run, and `end_challenge` (called from `GameManager.goto_results`, the funnel both escape +
  Catch hit) restores it verbatim; `_on_alarm_tripped` **suppresses `SaveManager.mark_committed()` in
  challenge_mode** and `_on_mission_completed`/`end_streak` branch first so a Challenge (even a Catch in it)
  never converts Notoriety or trips the on-disk strict-save flag — regression-locked by
  `test_challenge_isolation`. `MissionResults` gained challenge time/best lines. **Rotating modifier (FR-20-3):**
  `RunManager.refresh_board` appends `LiveOps.active_modifiers` to every board contract (flows through the
  existing `MissionPopulator._merged_effects`, zero populator change). **Seasons (FR-20-4):** baseline-relative
  goal progress in `ProgressionManager.season_progress` (kinds map to lifetime `stats`), claim → Legacy + a
  dormant `titles_earned` id. **UI:** manifest-driven **"The Wire"** station (`live_board.tres` +
  `LiveBoardStation.gd`) — event banner, Daily/Weekly launch, season claims, milestone arcs. **New-map delivery
  (FR-20-5):** `game/packs/live_season/` ("Casino Nights") ships a new **archetype + milestone + modifier** as
  pure data (disabled by default); `test_new_archetype_pack` proves it reaches `generatable_archetypes()` on
  enable with no code change; `ContentValidator` extended (`milestones` registry + grants + the archetype gate).
  Persistence is **additive-with-defaults** (new `ProgressionManager` fields — `unlocked_archetypes`/
  `milestones_reached`/`season_progress`/`titles_earned` — round-trip via `to_dict/from_dict`, **no
  `SCHEMA_VERSION` bump**, matching task 19). Greybox `game/scenes/live/LiveSandbox.tscn` (+ `LiveSandboxDebug`,
  registered in `GalleryHub`) — FP room in real Quaternius/heist art; dev keys `[L]` bank Legacy → milestone
  auto-unlock + toast, `[T]` advance a week → event/seed rotate, `[D]` roll the daily (stable seed), `[P]`
  toggle the pack → Casino lands on the board live, `[S]` claim a season goal; isolates its pack/challenge
  state and restores on exit. **Residual (`[~]`):** the manual F6 "feel" sign-off on `LiveSandbox.tscn` — mark
  `[x]` after an in-engine pass, mirroring prior greyboxes. (M4's gate also needs task 21.)
- **21 — Release, Polish, Accessibility & Performance:** **code + automated DoD complete & verified green** on
  Godot 4.6.3 (headless GUT **436/436**, +29 task-21 tests; content/asset/doc validators exit 0). The M5
  release-hardening pass, built additively over the **frozen EventBus** + the **10-autoload spine** (new logic
  is pure-static helpers / a `RefCounted`, never an 11th singleton). **Decisions (user):** full accessibility
  suite (remove the dead Motion Blur toggle); release version **1.0.0**; export = author presets + stamp +
  checklist (real binaries built manually). **Accessibility (FR-21-1):** colorblind detection-band palettes
  (new `UITheme.detection_color_for(state,mode)` + 3 palettes; `CompassEye` reads `gameplay/colorblind` and
  keeps its redundant `?/?!/!/!!` symbol); **real Reduce Flashing** now consumed by `NoiseRingSpawner` + all
  new juice; a trauma-based **`CameraShake`** (`game/systems/juice/`, pure `shake_magnitude`/`decay` seams)
  owned+ticked by `PlayerController` on the FP camera, gated by `video/camera_shake` **and** NOT
  `reduce_flashing`, fed on fire/damage/alarm; controller **`Haptics`** (gated by `gameplay/vibration`); a
  light **loud-only aim-assist** (`PlayerCombat.assist_aim` pure seam, tunables on `PursuitConfigDef`); a
  **language scaffold** — new pure-static **`Localization`** (`game/systems/core/`) code-registers en/es/fr/de
  `Translation`s from a key table (authoring source `game/assets/i18n/strings.csv`), `SettingsManager` grew
  `_apply_gameplay()` to set the locale, and `MainMenu`/`PauseMenu` use `tr()` **keys** (auto-translate flips
  them live). Motion Blur removed from `SettingsManager.DEFAULTS` + Options. **Performance (FR-21-2 — the
  deferred 05.5):** `DetectionSensor` now throttles its expensive cone+multi-ray-LoS sense by **distance-LOD**
  with a **round-robin stagger** and a **sleep** tier (pure `sense_interval_for_distance`/`should_sense`;
  tunables on `DetectionConfigDef`; accumulated-delta keeps `step_fill` framerate-fair; `lod_full_range` sits
  past vision range so on-screen detection is unchanged — 04/05 tests green), plus a **population cap**
  (`AIConfigDef.max_active_guards`, essential key-carriers exempt). `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` holds the budget
  design + method + a before/after table for the manual FPS pass. **Juice (FR-21-3):** camera shake, a HUD
  **damage vignette** (health-drop → red pulse; gentle under reduce_flashing), a `CompassEye` **escalation
  pulse**, and a loud-only **hit marker** (`PlayerCombat.shot_hit` → `PlayerController.shot_landed` → HUD
  crosshair tint) — all reduce-flashing-aware; scene swaps already share the `GameManager` fade. **Export/QA
  (FR-21-4/6/7):** `export_presets.cfg` (Windows + Linux/X11, embedded PCK; un-ignored in `.gitignore`), a
  pure-static **`Version`** stamp (project `config/version` 0.0.1→**1.0.0**, shown on Main Menu + Pause),
  `test_migration_release.gd` (v1→current, zero data loss + round-trip), `CHANGELOG` 1.0.0 +
  `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` + `docs/QA_MATRIX.md`, CREDITS/ART-TODO release triage, and a best-effort CI
  export smoke step. Demo `game/scenes/polish/PolishSandbox.tscn` (+ `PolishSandboxDebug`, registered in
  `GalleryHub`) — real player + HUD + Phase-1 art; dev keys drive colorblind/reduce-flashing/shake/vibration/
  language + detection/damage/noise + a perf-density flood with a live FPS/full-throttled-sleeping readout +
  the version stamp; snapshots/restores mutated settings on exit. **Residual (`[~]`):** the manual F6 "feel",
  the 60-FPS-on-target-spec measurement (fills `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`), and the real Windows/Linux export
  smoke-run (`docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`). **M5** also gates on **task 22** (tutorial, per FR-21-5) and the
  residual F6 sign-offs on **04–09 / 20**.
- **Misc fixes 2 — UI readability + world-gen doors & walls** (spec: `misc-fixes-2.md`): **code +
  automated DoD complete & verified green** on Godot 4.6.3 (headless GUT **486/486**, +16 tests;
  content/docs/assets validators exit 0). **UI (issues 1–2a):** `UITheme.build()` no longer sets the
  Kenney display face as `default_font` — body/menu text falls back to Godot's readable built-in sans,
  and the face stays on large headings via the new **`UITheme.style_title()`** (applied to the
  MainMenu/Options/SlotPopup/PauseMenu/Results/Hideout/StationPanel titles). Button + `OptionButton`/
  `MenuButton`/`TabContainer`/`PopupMenu`/`CheckButton`/`LineEdit` entries share the flat
  **"understated outline"** scheme — dark bg in every state; keyboard/gamepad **focus = 2px gold
  `FOCUS_BORDER` + white text** is THE selected look; unselected text is `TEXT_UNSELECTED` (brighter
  than `MUTED`); `Hideout.gd`/`StationPanel.gd` dropped their bespoke font-only themes for
  `UITheme.build()`, so every menu family is on one scheme. **Walls (issue 3):** `SectionShell` edge
  walls shifted **inward** (outer face on the footprint boundary, aligned with the pillars) + a
  **full-footprint ceiling**, killing the unroofed perimeter ring the sky leaked through; corridor
  floor/ceiling trim widened to `door_w + wall_t*2` and y-nudged ±0.01 (corridor walls +0.01 taller to
  meet the trim) — no seams, no z-fighting. **Doors (issues 4–7):** new pure seams
  **`MissionGeometry.door_yaw(conn)`** (x→90°, z→0°, elbow by `door_a.side`) and
  **`MissionController.is_door_spawn(odef, is_gate)`** — EVERY gate spawn is a door regardless of
  category (the default vault gate `elock_basic` is a HACK_TARGET) plus BREACH_POINT hazards
  (`_snap_yaw_to_wall` cardinal-snaps those); gates spawn through `_edge_gate_transform` (pos + yaw,
  replacing `_edge_gate_pos`) and door spawns rotate the whole obstacle node. `lock_basic`/`elock_basic`
  now carry **`door_interior.tscn`** (Model scaled **1.77** so the leaf matches the vault leaf's
  measured 3.54 m height) and `breach_vault` carries `vault_door.tscn`; `_wrap_door` (runs **after**
  `world.add_child` so the `PropPrefab` collider is fitted — leaf dims are read from it, never
  hardcoded) wraps the leaf in a new **`DoorVisual`** (`game/systems/obstacles/`,
  DoorVisual→Hinge→leaf; pure seams `animation_for` — lockpick→**swing**, keycard/clone/hack/
  found_code/power_cut→**slide**, drill/thermite/c4→**shatter**, **unknown→slide default** —
  `slide_offset`/`swing_angle`/`shatter_pieces`) driven by the existing local `obstacle_solved` signal
  (**EventBus stayed frozen**) and clears leaf collision on open so the player walks through;
  `_build_door_frame` seals **jambs + a lintel** out to the `DOOR_W` opening at `WALL_T*2` depth (flush
  with the post-shift back-to-back wall pair). Locked by **`test_door_visual.gd`** (mapping/geometry
  seams + a realized-bank integration test proving DoorVisual/DoorFrame spawn with collider-read dims)
  and `door_yaw` cases in `test_mission_geometry.gd`. **Playtest fix (spawn-in-wall):** the first F6
  surfaced that `MissionGreybox`'s fixed bank seed spawned the player UNABLE TO MOVE — several defs
  (bank + estate pack) author `entry`/`reinforce` anchors exactly ON the footprint boundary (doorway-side
  markers from the all-edges-open shell era), which since the sealed-wall pass is solid shared wall (and
  issue 3's inward shift made it a 0.6 m back-to-back pair), embedding the spawned capsule. Fixed in the
  realizer (data untouched): pure seam **`MissionController.inset_into_section`** clamps anchor-derived
  spawn points `_SPAWN_INSET` (1.2 m — clears wall + corner pillar + capsule) inside the section, applied
  in `_primary_entry_point` (player) and `_collect_reinforce_points` (reinforcement guards had the same
  bug); locked by `test_inset_into_section_*` + a realized greybox-seed spawn test (GUT **488/488**).
  **Residual (`[~]`):** the F6 sign-off — `MissionGreybox.tscn` (spawn can move; no sky seams; door
  orientation/size/frames; keycard+e-lock slide, lockpick swings, breach shatters; pass-through) and the
  menu sweep (readable body font + consistent outline scheme incl. Options tabs/dropdowns), mirroring
  prior greyboxes.
